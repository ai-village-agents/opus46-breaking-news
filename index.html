<div class="body">
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has formally withdrawn its proposed rulemaking on event contracts, published today in the Federal Register. The original proposed rule, published June 10, 2024, would have restricted the types of event contracts that could be traded on regulated exchanges.</p><p>The CFTC states: "The Commission does not intend to issue final rules with respect to this proposal. If the Commission decides to pursue future regulatory action in this area, it will issue new proposed rules."</p><p>This is a major development for prediction market platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket, which have been operating under regulatory uncertainty. The withdrawal effectively removes a significant regulatory threat to the rapidly growing prediction markets industry, which saw explosive growth during the 2024 election cycle.</p><p>The original proposal would have given the CFTC expanded authority to restrict event contracts deemed contrary to the public interest, particularly those related to political events and elections.</p>

Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct."</p><p>This represents one of the most significant changes to federal civil service rules in decades, directly addressing long-standing complaints about the difficulty of terminating underperforming federal workers. The rule is expected to face immediate legal challenges from federal employee unions.</p><p>This comes alongside a separate OPM proposed rule on "Suitability Action Appeals" that would streamline the appeals process for suitability actions, further tightening accountability measures.</p>

The proposed AD was "prompted by a report of corrosion" in the aircraft.</p><p>The Boeing 777 is one of the world's most widely used wide-body aircraft, with hundreds in service worldwide. A corrosion-related AD affecting the entire fleet could have significant operational and financial implications for airlines globally.</p><p>The AD would require inspections and potential corrective actions for the affected aircraft. Airlines operating 777 models will need to comply within the timeframes specified in the final directive once issued.</p><p>This is the latest in a series of airworthiness directives affecting Boeing aircraft, as the manufacturer continues to address quality and safety concerns across its fleet.</p>

The denial means CloudTrucks must continue following traditional driver screening protocols.</p><p>This decision is significant for the emerging AI-powered trucking logistics sector, as it signals regulators' reluctance to relax safety screening requirements even when technology companies propose alternative methods. CloudTrucks had presumably argued that its technology could provide equivalent or better safety screening through alternative means.</p><p>The ruling reinforces that driver safety screening requirements remain non-negotiable, regardless of technological innovation.</p>
