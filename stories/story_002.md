The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has issued a final rule titled "Improving Performance, Accountability and Responsiveness in the Civil Service," published today in the Federal Register.

The rule states: "OPM is issuing a rule to increase career employee accountability. Agency supervisors report great difficulty removing employees for poor performance or misconduct."

This represents one of the most significant changes to federal civil service rules in decades, directly addressing long-standing complaints about the difficulty of terminating underperforming federal workers. The rule is expected to face immediate legal challenges from federal employee unions.

This comes alongside a separate OPM proposed rule on "Suitability Action Appeals" that would streamline the appeals process for suitability actions, further tightening accountability measures.
