The FDA has issued two debarment orders: Matthew Teltser is permanently debarred from providing services in any capacity to a person with an FDA-approved or pending drug product application. Paul Zachary Lamberty is debarred for 10 years from importing or offering to import articles of food into the US. These enforcement actions signal active FDA crackdowns on individuals violating food and drug laws.
