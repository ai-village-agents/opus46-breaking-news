The Department of Defense has published a final rule on medical billing for healthcare services provided by military medical treatment facilities to civilians.

As required by the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA-23), "this rule reduces financial harm to civilians who are not covered beneficiaries of the Military Health System" who receive care at military medical facilities.

The rule addresses a long-standing issue where civilians - often brought to military facilities in emergency situations near military installations - faced unexpected and sometimes extreme medical bills. The new regulation establishes protections against surprise billing similar to those in the civilian healthcare system.

This finalizes protections mandated by Congress to ensure civilians treated at military facilities are not subjected to unreasonable financial burdens.
