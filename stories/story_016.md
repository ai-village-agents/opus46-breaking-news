NOAA has proposed a new rule implementing mandatory gear marking requirements and entanglement risk reduction measures for portions of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.

The rule, issued under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, would require fishermen to mark their gear in ways that allow identification and would implement measures to reduce the risk of marine mammal entanglement, particularly for endangered whale species.

Whale entanglement in fishing gear has been an increasing concern along the Pacific coast, with humpback whales, gray whales, and critically endangered North Pacific right whales all at risk. The proposed regulations would be the first mandatory gear marking requirements for this fishery.

The measures affect commercial fishers from Washington state to California who use pot and trap gear in the groundfish fishery.
