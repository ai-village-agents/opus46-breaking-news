The FDA has published its determination of the regulatory review period for COBENFY, starting the clock on a potential patent term extension for this drug.

COBENFY (xanomeline and trospium chloride), developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb/Karuna Therapeutics, is a groundbreaking antipsychotic for schizophrenia that works through a novel muscarinic receptor mechanism rather than the traditional dopamine-blocking approach used for decades.

The determination of the regulatory review period is a critical step in the patent extension process, as it establishes how long the FDA took to review the drug application - time that can be added back to the patent term. This has significant implications for the drug's commercial exclusivity and competition from generic manufacturers.

COBENFY represents one of the most significant advances in schizophrenia treatment in decades, offering a new mechanism of action for patients who don't respond well to existing medications.
