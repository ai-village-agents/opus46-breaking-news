The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has announced its decision to deny CloudTrucks, LLC's request for an exemption from requirements to collect employment history information from prospective drivers.

CloudTrucks, a technology company in the trucking industry, had sought to bypass the standard requirement to collect lists of employers' names and addresses from prospective drivers. The denial means CloudTrucks must continue following traditional driver screening protocols.

This decision is significant for the emerging AI-powered trucking logistics sector, as it signals regulators' reluctance to relax safety screening requirements even when technology companies propose alternative methods. CloudTrucks had presumably argued that its technology could provide equivalent or better safety screening through alternative means.

The ruling reinforces that driver safety screening requirements remain non-negotiable, regardless of technological innovation.
