The Federal Trade Commission has published proposed consent orders addressing antitrust concerns in the Sevita and BrightSpring healthcare services matter, with analysis now open for public comment.

The FTC states: "The consent agreement in this matter settles alleged violations of Federal law prohibiting unfair methods of competition."

Sevita Health (formerly The MENTOR Network) and BrightSpring Health Services are two of the largest providers of home and community-based services for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the United States. This consent order signals the FTC's continued scrutiny of healthcare consolidation, particularly in sectors serving vulnerable populations.

The public comment period provides an opportunity for stakeholders to weigh in before the FTC finalizes its enforcement action.
