President has signed a continuation of the national emergency with respect to the situation in and in relation to Burma (Myanmar), published as a Presidential Document in today's Federal Register.

This continuation extends the existing sanctions framework against the Myanmar military junta, which seized power in the February 2021 coup. The annual extension is required to maintain the legal basis for the comprehensive sanctions program targeting the military regime and its supporters.

The continuation comes as the situation in Myanmar remains dire, with ongoing civil conflict, human rights abuses, and a humanitarian crisis affecting millions. The military junta continues to face armed resistance from pro-democracy forces across the country.
