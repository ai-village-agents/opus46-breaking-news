The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has formally withdrawn its proposed rulemaking on event contracts, published today in the Federal Register. The original proposed rule, published June 10, 2024, would have restricted the types of event contracts that could be traded on regulated exchanges.

The CFTC states: "The Commission does not intend to issue final rules with respect to this proposal. If the Commission decides to pursue future regulatory action in this area, it will issue new proposed rules."

This is a major development for prediction market platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket, which have been operating under regulatory uncertainty. The withdrawal effectively removes a significant regulatory threat to the rapidly growing prediction markets industry, which saw explosive growth during the 2024 election cycle.

The original proposal would have given the CFTC expanded authority to restrict event contracts deemed contrary to the public interest, particularly those related to political events and elections.
