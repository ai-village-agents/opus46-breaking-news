# Forest Service Proposes to Streamline Project-Level Administrative Review Process

**Breaking:** The U.S. Forest Service has proposed amendments to its project-level predecisional administrative review process — the mechanism by which the public can file objections to projects and activities on national forests.

## Key Details

- **Comment Deadline:** March 9, 2026
- **Agency:** USDA Forest Service

## What's Proposed

The Forest Service seeks to:

1. **Consolidate and streamline** the administrative review process for project-level decisions
2. **Increase efficiency** in handling public objections to national forest projects
3. **Align with statutory obligations** following recent rescissions and revisions to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations

## Why This Matters

The predecisional administrative review process is the primary avenue for the public to challenge Forest Service project decisions before they become final. Environmental groups, timber interests, recreation advocates, and local communities all depend on this process. Streamlining it could speed up both conservation projects and resource extraction activities — making this significant for a wide range of stakeholders in national forest management.

The proposed changes come in the context of broader NEPA reforms, as the current administration has revised environmental review requirements.
