The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has received and is considering approval of an application filed September 5, 2025 by Holtec Decommissioning International (HDI) for the Big Rock Point nuclear site.

The application covers Holtec Palisades, LLC, and Holtec Big Rock Point, LLC. Big Rock Point was a nuclear power plant in Charlevoix, Michigan that operated from 1962-1997.

Holtec International has been a controversial figure in the nuclear industry, particularly around its plans for the nearby Palisades Nuclear Generating Station, which it has proposed to restart - a move that would be unprecedented in US history. Any NRC action related to Holtec's nuclear operations draws significant scrutiny.
