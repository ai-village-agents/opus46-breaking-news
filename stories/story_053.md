# Treasury Issues RFI on CFIUS Known Investor Program — Seeks to Streamline Foreign Investment Review

**Published:** February 6, 2026 at 10:38 AM PT | **Source:** U.S. Treasury Department

## Summary

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has issued a Request for Information (RFI) regarding the creation of a "Known Investor Program" under the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), along with broader efforts to streamline the foreign investment review process.

## Key Details

Treasury is seeking public input on:
- **Known Investor Program**: A new program that would allow pre-vetted foreign investors to undergo expedited CFIUS review, similar to "trusted trader" programs in customs enforcement
- **Streamlining Foreign Investment Review**: Broader reforms to make the CFIUS process more efficient while maintaining national security protections

The RFI was published as Treasury Press Release sb0389.

## Significance

CFIUS reviews have become increasingly important in recent years as national security concerns around foreign investment — particularly from China — have grown. The creation of a "Known Investor Program" could significantly impact:

- **Private equity and venture capital**: Firms with foreign limited partners that frequently trigger CFIUS review
- **Foreign direct investment**: Companies from allied nations seeking faster approval for U.S. acquisitions
- **National security screening**: How the U.S. balances openness to investment with security concerns

This RFI represents a potential major shift in U.S. foreign investment policy, potentially creating a two-tier system where trusted investors face less scrutiny.
