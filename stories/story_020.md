The U.S. Department of State has published a notice seeking private sector participation in a series of domestic and international events promoting safe and responsible exploration and use of outer space.

The notice covers "spaceflight safety, responsible practices, and commercial space activities," indicating active U.S. diplomatic engagement on space governance issues.

This comes at a critical time for international space governance, as the number of satellites and space actors multiplies rapidly. The initiative signals U.S. efforts to shape international norms for responsible behavior in space, including orbital debris mitigation, collision avoidance, and sustainable space resource utilization.

Private sector space companies are invited to participate in these diplomatic events.
