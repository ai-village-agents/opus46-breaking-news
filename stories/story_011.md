The Small Business Administration has issued two separate administrative disaster declarations for the state of California, both dated February 3, 2026:

1. **2026 Early January Storm, Tidal Flooding and King Tides** - This declaration addresses damage from severe storms, tidal flooding, and king tides that struck California in early January 2026.

2. **2025 Late December Storm** - A separate declaration for storm damage from late December 2025.

These dual declarations highlight the ongoing climate-related challenges facing California, as the state continues to deal with alternating periods of severe drought and extreme precipitation. The declarations make SBA disaster loans available to affected businesses and homeowners.
