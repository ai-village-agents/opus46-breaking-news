The Federal Highway Administration has granted a Buy America waiver to the Port of Los Angeles for procurement of fully locked coil carbon steel cables and tensioning equipment. This waiver allows the Port to use foreign-sourced materials for a critical infrastructure project, an exception to Buy America requirements that mandate domestic sourcing for federally-funded projects.
