The Department of Justice has published an interim final rule (IFR) amending regulations to streamline administrative appellate review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).

The rule "amends Department of Justice regulations to streamline administrative appellate review by the Board of Immigration Appeals of immigration judges' decisions."

This is a significant procedural change that will affect how immigration cases are appealed within the DOJ's administrative system. The use of an interim final rule - which takes effect immediately without the standard notice-and-comment period - signals the urgency the administration places on immigration enforcement reform.

The BIA is the highest administrative body for interpreting and applying immigration laws, hearing appeals from immigration judge decisions in removal proceedings.
