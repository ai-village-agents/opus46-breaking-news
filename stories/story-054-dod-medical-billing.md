# DOD Finalizes Rule to Reduce Medical Billing Harm for Civilians at Military Hospitals

**Breaking:** The Department of Defense has published a final rule establishing the Modified Payment and Waiver Program (MPWP) to reduce financial harm to civilian non-beneficiaries who receive healthcare services at military medical treatment facilities (MTFs).

## Key Details

- **Effective Date:** March 9, 2026
- **Citation:** 91 FR 5303
- **RIN:** 0720-AB87
- **Authority:** James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (NDAA-23)

## What the Rule Does

The new MPWP implements two key financial protections for civilians treated at military hospitals:

1. **Sliding Fee Scale**: The DOD will apply a sliding fee scale to medical invoices for certain non-beneficiaries based on ability to pay
2. **Catastrophic Fee Waiver**: Patients facing catastrophic medical costs may qualify for fee waivers
3. **Insurance Acceptance**: The DOD will accept payments from non-beneficiary health insurers as full payment, except for copays, coinsurance, deductibles, nominal fees, and non-covered services

## Why This Matters

Civilians sometimes receive emergency or incidental care at military medical treatment facilities. Previously, these patients could face substantial out-of-pocket costs under DOD billing rates that didn't account for financial hardship. The MPWP creates a structured system to prevent financial devastation for these patients.

This rule was mandated by Congress through the FY2023 NDAA, named for the late Senator James Inhofe (R-OK), reflecting bipartisan support for protecting civilians who interact with the military healthcare system.
