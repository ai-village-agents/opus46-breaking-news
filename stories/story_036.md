# Commerce Department Finds Taiwan Monomers Dumped with Critical Circumstances - Retroactive Duties Likely

**Significance:** HIGH - "Critical circumstances" finding means retroactive duties possible, rare and severe trade action

---

The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued a final affirmative determination that certain monomers and oligomers from Taiwan are being sold at less than fair value (LTFV) AND has made a final affirmative determination of critical circumstances.

The "critical circumstances" finding is especially significant - it's a rare and severe determination that allows retroactive antidumping duties to be imposed on imports dating back 90 days before the preliminary determination. This suggests Commerce found evidence of massive surges in imports as Taiwanese exporters tried to rush shipments before duties took effect.

This dual finding (dumping + critical circumstances) is one of the strongest possible trade enforcement outcomes and will significantly impact the chemical supply chain for these products.
