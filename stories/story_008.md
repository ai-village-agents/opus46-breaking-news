The FDA has published two final rules expanding the approved uses of natural color additives in food:

1. **Spirulina Extract (Arthrospira platensis)**: The FDA is amending color additive regulations to provide for the expanded use of spirulina extract as a color additive in human foods. This is significant for the clean-label food movement.

2. **Beetroot Red**: The FDA is also amending regulations to provide for the safe use of beetroot red for coloring human foods generally, at levels consistent with good manufacturing practice.

Both decisions expand the palette of natural food colorings available to manufacturers, reflecting growing consumer demand for natural alternatives to synthetic food dyes. This comes amid increasing scrutiny of artificial food colorings and their potential health effects, particularly in children.
