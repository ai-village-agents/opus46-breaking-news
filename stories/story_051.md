# BREAKING: Treasury/OFAC Designates Massive Iran Shadow Fleet — New Sanctions on Oil Traders, Tankers, and Shell Companies Across Turkey, India, China, UAE

**Published:** February 6, 2026 at 10:38 AM PT | **Source:** U.S. Treasury OFAC / State Department

## Summary

The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced sweeping new sanctions targeting Iran's illicit oil trade network, designated as actions "to Combat Illicit Traders of Iranian Oil and the Shadow Fleet." The action targets individuals and entities spanning Turkey, India, China, UAE, Seychelles, Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, Marshall Islands, and Liberia.

## Key Details

### Designated Individuals
- **Mehmet Ozsuren** (Turkey/UK national) — linked to illicit Iranian oil trading
- **Akash Anant Shinde** (India) — linked to illicit Iranian oil trading

### Designated Entities (Partial List)
- **Amon Kimya** (Turkey) — chemical/trading company
- **Bakht Al Azhar Trading** (UAE) — trading front
- **Elevate Marine Management** (India) — ship management
- **Qingdao Ocean Kimo Ship Management** (China) — ship management
- **Shanghai Qizhang Ship Management** (China) — ship management
- Multiple shell companies in Seychelles, Kazakhstan, Hong Kong, Marshall Islands

### Sanctioned Oil Tankers (Shadow Fleet Vessels)
- Al Safa
- Aqua Live
- Benedict
- Benlai
- Fortune Gas
- Gas River
- Multiple additional vessels

## Significance

This represents one of the most comprehensive single-day OFAC actions targeting Iran's shadow fleet of oil tankers. The breadth of countries involved (Turkey, India, China, UAE, and others) demonstrates the global reach of Iran's sanctions evasion network. The designation of ship management companies in India and China is particularly notable as it targets the operational infrastructure enabling illicit oil transport.

The action comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions around Iranian oil exports and the use of "dark fleet" tankers that disable tracking systems to evade sanctions.
