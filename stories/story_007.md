The FAA has proposed to supersede an existing airworthiness directive (AD 2023-26-04) for all Rolls-Royce Deutschland Trent 1000 series engines, including models AE3, CE3, D3, and G3.

The Trent 1000 is one of two engine options for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, powering a significant portion of the global 787 fleet. This superseding AD indicates ongoing concerns that require updated corrective actions beyond the existing directive.

Rolls-Royce has faced persistent issues with the Trent 1000 engine family, which have caused significant disruption to airlines operating 787s powered by these engines. Previous issues have led to aircraft groundings and costly engine replacements.
