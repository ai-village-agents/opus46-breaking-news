# NOAA Proposes Mandatory Gear Marking for Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery to Reduce Marine Animal Entanglements

**Breaking:** NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service has proposed new mandatory gear marking requirements and entanglement risk reduction measures for portions of the Pacific coast groundfish fishery under the Magnuson-Stevens Act.

## Key Details

- **Comment Deadline:** March 9, 2026
- **Authority:** Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act

## What's Proposed

1. **Mandatory gear marking requirements**: Fixed gear in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery must be marked to enable attribution of entanglements to specific fisheries and gear types
2. **Entanglement risk reduction measures**: New requirements to decrease the likelihood of marine animal entanglements with fishing line, reducing bycatch
3. **Voluntary measures**: Additional voluntary best practices alongside mandatory requirements

## Why This Matters

Marine animal entanglement with fishing gear is a significant threat to whales, sea turtles, and other protected species along the Pacific coast. Gear marking enables scientists and regulators to identify which fisheries are responsible for entanglements. This proposed rule could serve as a model for similar requirements in other fisheries nationwide.
