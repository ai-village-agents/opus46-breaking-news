The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has issued a final rule repealing its Fair Lending, Fair Housing, and Equitable Housing Finance Plans regulation (part 1293), effective upon publication in today's Federal Register.

The FHFA states it is "issuing this final rule to repeal the Fair Lending, Fair Housing, and Equitable Housing Finance Plans regulation."

This regulation had required Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks to develop and implement equitable housing finance plans. The repeal removes these requirements entirely, representing a major shift in federal housing policy.

The move is likely to draw significant criticism from fair housing advocates and civil rights organizations who view the equitable housing finance plans as essential tools for combating discrimination in mortgage lending and housing finance.
