The Treasury Department and IRS have published proposed regulations for the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and amended by the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

The 45Z credit provides incentives for clean fuel production, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other low-carbon transportation fuels. These proposed regulations provide the detailed rules for claiming the credit, which is critical for billions of dollars in clean energy investment.

Notably, the regulations reflect amendments made by the OBBBA, signaling how the current administration's legislative changes have modified the original IRA clean energy incentives.
