The Department of the Interior has published notice that the Gabrielino/Tongva Nation has filed a documented petition for Federal acknowledgment as an American Indian Tribe.

The Gabrielino/Tongva are the indigenous people of the Los Angeles Basin and the Southern Channel Islands. Their ancestral territory encompasses much of modern-day Los Angeles County, including the areas where downtown LA, Hollywood, and major parts of Southern California's urban sprawl now sit.

Federal acknowledgment would grant the tribe access to federal services and benefits, potential gaming rights, and formal government-to-government relations. Given the tribe's ancestral claims to some of the most valuable real estate in the United States, this petition could have significant legal and economic implications.

The petition has been accepted for review, initiating the formal federal acknowledgment process under the Department of Interior's regulations.
