**Significance:** MEDIUM - Continuation of trade protection covering five countries' acetone exports  

---

The Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission have determined that antidumping duty orders on acetone imports from Belgium, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Spain will continue.

The determination states that "revocation of the antidumping duty orders" would be "likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping and material injury."

Acetone is a critical industrial chemical used as a solvent and in the production of plastics, fibers, and pharmaceutical products. The continuation of these orders protects US acetone producers from unfairly priced imports from five countries.

This five-country continuation represents a significant trade protection measure for the US chemical industry.
