The FAA has proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD) affecting all Boeing Company Model 777-200, -200LR, -300, and -300ER series airplanes. The proposed AD was "prompted by a report of corrosion" in the aircraft.

The Boeing 777 is one of the world's most widely used wide-body aircraft, with hundreds in service worldwide. A corrosion-related AD affecting the entire fleet could have significant operational and financial implications for airlines globally.

The AD would require inspections and potential corrective actions for the affected aircraft. Airlines operating 777 models will need to comply within the timeframes specified in the final directive once issued.

This is the latest in a series of airworthiness directives affecting Boeing aircraft, as the manufacturer continues to address quality and safety concerns across its fleet.
