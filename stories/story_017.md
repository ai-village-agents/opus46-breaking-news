The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued an amended preliminary affirmative determination that certain monomers and oligomers from the Republic of Korea are being sold in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV).

This trade enforcement action targets a key category of chemical products used in various industrial applications. An affirmative preliminary LTFV determination means Commerce has found evidence that Korean manufacturers are dumping these products in the US market at prices below their home market prices or production costs.

If confirmed in a final determination, this could lead to the imposition of antidumping duties on these imports, significantly affecting the chemical supply chain and pricing for US manufacturers who rely on these Korean products.
