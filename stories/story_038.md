The Secretary of Homeland Security has exercised time-limited authority to increase the FY2026 H-2B temporary nonagricultural worker visa cap by up to 64,716 additional visas.

This represents a near-doubling of the standard H-2B cap of 66,000 visas per year. The supplemental visas address severe labor shortages in industries like landscaping, hospitality, seafood processing, and seasonal tourism.

The H-2B program allows US employers to bring foreign nationals for temporary non-agricultural work when domestic workers are not available.
