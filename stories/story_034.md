The US Fish and Wildlife Service is reopening the comment period on its May 2025 proposed rule to list the Fish Lake Valley tui chub (Siphateles obesus ssp.) as endangered. This fish, found in Esmeralda County, Nevada, faces extinction risks from habitat loss and water depletion in the arid Great Basin.
