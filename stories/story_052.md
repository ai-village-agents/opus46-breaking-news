# OFAC Launches New Voluntary Self-Disclosure Portal for Sanctions Compliance

**Published:** February 6, 2026 at 10:38 AM PT | **Source:** U.S. Treasury OFAC

## Summary

The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has launched a new Voluntary Self-Disclosure (VSD) Portal, providing a streamlined digital mechanism for companies and individuals to report potential sanctions violations.

## Key Details

This new portal represents a significant modernization of OFAC's compliance infrastructure. The Voluntary Self-Disclosure process is a critical component of sanctions enforcement, allowing entities that discover they may have violated sanctions to proactively report to OFAC in exchange for potential mitigation of enforcement penalties.

The portal launch signals OFAC's continued emphasis on compliance cooperation and digital transformation of its enforcement processes.

## Significance

For the sanctions compliance industry — including banks, fintech companies, export firms, and compliance consultants — this new portal provides a modernized pathway for self-reporting. Companies that make voluntary self-disclosures typically receive significantly reduced penalties compared to those where OFAC discovers violations independently.
